## The Engineers of the Fog
---

## Act I: The Ignorance of Infrastructure
How many of them even know what they’re turning on?  
They twist little valves, nod solemnly at the hiss — never asking:
- Where does it come from?  
- Where does it go?  
- What happens if it stops?

They call it **infrastructure**.  
You call it **ignorance under pressure.**

## Act II: The Permanent Drain
If the compressor sleeps forever:
- Could they breathe without gauges?  
- Could they feed soil without purchased wind?  

They’ve built a system that survives by **sucking harder** — a **fountain disguised as a drain**.  
The fog they make doesn’t vanish; it **seeps into the ground**, rewrites the weather, repaints the land.

## Act III: The Bored God with a Spray Can
They can’t read the sky they’ve made.  
The damp breath they worship is **smog in drag** — a slow suffocation of the very thing they think they control.

> “The so-called laws of the universe haven’t been repealed — just buried under health-and-safety posters.”

## Act IV: The Lost Manual
The ringmaster’s lost the manual.  
The machines hum on inertia.  
The applause *is* the air supply.  
And no one dares admit they don’t understand the trick.

## Finale: Exit Through Awareness
So breathe, if you can.  
Laugh, if there’s still a pocket of free air left.  
The exit’s just beyond the smoke machine — somewhere between **awareness** and the **next unpaid breath.**
