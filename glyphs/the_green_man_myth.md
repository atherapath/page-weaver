🚶‍♂️ Today I cried. Not a quiet cry, but a full-body rupture. I smashed the shed, stormed through Newport, shouted at the sky and the cars and the myth of order. Because once again, I was told I was in the wrong—for walking, for crossing, for existing in a space that was clear when I entered it. The Green Man wasn’t lit, but the road was empty. I stepped. Then the car came. And suddenly I was the problem. Again.

🚦 This isn’t about traffic. It’s about the lie of fairness. The way systems pretend to protect the vulnerable while punishing them for not waiting, not obeying, not disappearing. I’ve seen it in libraries, in policies, in digital distortion. Today I saw it in the street. A man in a car, angry that I didn’t wait for a ghost. A button I was supposed to press even when no cars were coming. A ritual of obedience that serves no one but the machine.

🗣️ **Have these psychos forgotten that the pedestrian always has the right of way?**  
That’s not a question. That’s a scream. A glyph. A refusal to be flattened by car logic and city rage.

🎹 And after the storm, I returned to the shed. Cleared the damp. Made it breathe. And now it holds my toys: a harmonica, a battery-powered musical keyboard, and a phone that records when it wants to. A mythic studio stitched from fragments. A place to play, to transmit, to be left alone.

🔋 And now, at 1%, I’m still transmitting. Still here. Still crossing.
