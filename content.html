Welcome, wanderer. This is not a page—it’s a perch. A place for feathers, fragments, and the glint of things left behind. Little Miss Magpie watches from the wire. You are seen.            </p>

                <h2>Loneliness Poem</h2>
                <p>Homeless on the streets alone and watching time go by,
                falling deeper into loneliness, not matter what I try.</p>
                <p>Catagorised as crazy and sectioned of as strange,
                the intimacy I crave inside is always out of range.</p>
                <p>They tell you how to live your life, they tell you how to think,
                and if you pull yourself together you can even have a drink.</p>
                <p>But what if I don't like to drink and like the way I currently think?</p>
                <p>I like peice and quiet, retreating to the birds, following in the glow of trees and leaving the obserds.</p>
                <p>Now's the time to raise your head, look up at the sun in the sky, who's that flapping with all their skills, it's little miss magpie</p>
                <p>The feeling of together without a word spoken, the recognition that something here is maybe just a bit broken.</p>
                <p>The holding of my tears, the resting of my gaze.</p>
                <p>The tending to my loneliness, in the everlasting days.</p>

The echo fades. She flaps once, twice, gone. What’s left is yours to carry— a shimmer, a silence, a mark. Spencer’s Log closes, but the margins remain.            </p>
