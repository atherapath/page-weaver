## The Gas-Powered Circus

## Opening Act: The Spectacle of Pressure
**Welcome**, ladies, gentlemen, and assorted mechanical attendees, to the grand **Gas-Powered Circus** — where everything hums, hisses, and breathes through a nozzle.  
Here, air itself has been:
- **Branded**
- **Bottled**
- **Metered**
- **Sold back to us as progress**

> “Take a bow, humanity — sorry, *man.* You’ve turned breath into currency and compressors into gods.”

## Act II: The Subscription to Breathing
Everywhere I look:
- A new valve  
- A new sigh of something being squeezed  
- Cities that forgot how to exhale  

The engines, the factories, the convenience pumps — all feeding on the same invisible trick: **pressurise the nothing, call it something, invoice it.**

We no longer breathe; we **subscribe** to breathing.  
Even laughter now comes in cans.

## Act III: The Clergy of Compression
Who’s running the show?
- NPCs with lanyards and policies  
- Flags of mild competence flapping in an artificial wind  

They don’t see the irony that the same gas powering their compressors keeps everyone else docile and dizzy.  

> *Science calls it chemistry; I call it alchemy by direct debit.*

## Act IV: Nature’s Rebellion
Outside the tent, nature does it all for free.
- Trees don’t invoice the wind.  
- Soil exhales in rhythm.  
- No barcodes, no pipelines, just pulse and release.  

So yes — it’s all compressed air at different levels.  
But it’s also an **opera of captivity**, every hiss a confession that we’ve traded lungs for pipelines.

## Curtain Call
The clowns here don’t wear paint; they wear ID badges.  
Their act? Convincing you the compressor is sacred, the hiss is holy.  

And while they bow to their machines, the rest of us hold our breath — paying by the litre for the right to exhale.
